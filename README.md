As a manager at an internet retail company, I created a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company and compete with other e-commerce companies.

Using a functional Express.js API, I added my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an enviornment variable file and am able to connect to a database using Sequalize.
I entered schema and seed commands so that a development database was created and seeded with test data.
Using the command line I was able to tell the application to start my server that is synced to the MySQL database and Sequalize models.
In insomnia I was able to open the API GET routes for categories, products and tags, and the data is displayed in a formatted JSON.
I was able to sucessfully text API POST, PUT and DELETE routes in insomnia and sucessfully create, update and delete data in my database.
